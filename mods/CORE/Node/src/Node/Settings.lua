---Supported for drawtypes "plantlike", "signlike", "torchlike",
---"firelike", "mesh", "nodebox", "allfaces".
---For plantlike and firelike, the image will start at the bottom of the

---on the node.

---The node's original color will be multiplied with this color.
---If the node has a palette, then this setting only has an effect in
---the inventory and on the wield item.
---@type string?
Settings.color = nil

---Specifies how the texture's alpha channel will be used for rendering.
---Possible values:
---* `"opaque"`:
---  Node is rendered opaque regardless of alpha channel.
---* `"clip"`:
---  A given pixel is either fully see-through or opaque
---  depending on the alpha channel being below/above 50% in value.
---  Use this for nodes with fully transparent and fully opaque areas.
---* `"blend"`:
---  The alpha channel specifies how transparent a given pixel
---  of the rendered node is. This comes at a performance cost.
---  Only use this when correct rendering
---  among semitransparent nodes is necessary.
---
---The default is `"opaque"` for drawtypes normal, liquid and flowingliquid,
---mesh and nodebox or "clip" otherwise.
---If set to a boolean value (deprecated): true either sets it to blend
---or clip, false sets it to clip or opaque mode depending on the drawtype.
---@type string?

---The node's `param2` is used to select a pixel from the image.

---Only when `paramtype2` supports palettes.

---If true, place_param2 is nil, and this is a wallmounted node,

---@type boolean?
Settings.wallmounted_rotate_vertical = nil

---If false, the cave generator and dungeon generator will not carve

---@type boolean?
Settings.walkable = nil

---Can be `true` if it is pointable, `false` if it can be pointed through,
---or `"blocking"` if it is pointable but not selectable.
---Clients older than 5.9.0 interpret `pointable = "blocking"` as `pointable = true`.
---Can be overridden by the `pointabilities` of the held item.

---If true, can be climbed on like a ladder.
---@type boolean?
Settings.climbable = nil

---Slows down movement of players through this node (max. 7).
---If this is nil, it will be equal to liquid_viscosity.
---Note: If liquid movement physics apply to the node

---affected by the `movement_liquid_*` settings.
---@type number?
Settings.move_resistance = nil

---If true, placed nodes can replace this node.

---Warning: making a liquid node 'floodable' will cause problems.
---@type boolean?

---specifies liquid flowing physics
---* `"none"`:    no liquid flowing physics
---* `"source"`:  spawns flowing liquid nodes at all 4 sides and below;
---             recommended drawtype: "liquid".
---* `"flowing"`: spawned from source, spawns more flowing liquid nodes
---             around it until `liquid_range` is reached;
---             will drain out without a source;
---             recommended drawtype: "flowingliquid".

---@type string?
Settings.liquidtype = nil

---These fields may contain node names that represent the
---flowing version (`liquid_alternative_flowing`) and
---source version (`liquid_alternative_source`) of a liquid.
---
---Specifically, these fields are required if `liquidtype ~= "none"` or
---`drawtype == "flowingliquid"`.
---
---Liquids consist of up to two nodes: source and flowing.
---
---There are two ways to define a liquid:
---1) Source node and flowing node. This requires both fields to be
---   specified for both nodes.
---2) Standalone source node (cannot flow). `liquid_alternative_source`
---   must be specified and `liquid_range` must be set to 0.
---
---Example:
---
---    liquid_alternative_flowing = `"example:water_flowing"`,
---    liquid_alternative_source = `"example:water_source"`,
---@type string?
Settings.liquid_alternative_flowing = nil

---See `Node.Settings.liquid_alternative_flowing`.
---@type string?
Settings.liquid_alternative_source = nil

---Controls speed at which the liquid spreads/flows (max. 7).
---0 is fastest, 7 is slowest.
---By default, this also slows down movement of players inside the node
---(can be overridden using `move_resistance`)
---@type number?
Settings.liquid_viscosity = nil

---If true, a new liquid source can be created by placing two or more
---sources nearby.
---@type boolean?
Settings.liquid_renewable = nil

---specifies movement physics if inside node
---* `false`: No liquid movement physics apply.
---* `true`: Enables liquid movement physics. Enables things like
---  ability to "swim" up/down, sinking slowly if not moving,
---  smoother speed change when falling into, etc. The `movement_liquid_*`
---  settings apply.
---* `nil`: Will be treated as true if `liquidtype ~= "none"`
---  and as false otherwise.
---@type boolean?

---Only valid for "nodebox" drawtype with 'type = "leveled"'.
---Allows defining the nodebox height without using param2.

---@type number?
Settings.leveled = nil

---Maximum value for `leveled` (0-127), enforced in

---@type table?
Settings.connect_sides = nil

---File name of mesh when using "mesh" drawtype
---The center of the node is the model origin.
---For legacy reasons, this uses a different scale depending on the mesh:
---1. For glTF models: 10 units = 1 node (consistent with the scale for entities).
---2. For obj models: 1 unit = 1 node.
---3. For b3d and x models: 1 unit = 1 node if static, otherwise 10 units = 1 node.
---
---Using static glTF or obj models is recommended.
---
---You can use the `visual_scale` multiplier to achieve the expected scale.
